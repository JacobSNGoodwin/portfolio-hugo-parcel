## About Me

My previous career and degrees were in Electrical Engineering. I previously worked for Sandia National Labs as a Microwave Engineer, and at Computer Simulation Technology as an expert and Solution Consultant in Antenna Simulation and Design. Starting a couple years ago I started learning Web Development from the endless supply of online tutorials and found that I really enjoyed it. After several years working with and consulting top hardware companies in Silicon Valley, I have decided to switch-up my career and dedicate myself to software.
